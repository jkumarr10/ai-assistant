Perhaps you stopped on the way to work or class to buy a\\nsoft drink or coffee, went to the gr ocery stor e on the way home to get br ead or milk, or or dered something\\nonline. Y ou likely make buying decisions nearly e very day and pr obably don ’t give most of those decisions\\nmuch thought. But the way you make those decisions is significant for marketers, because if the y can\\nunderstand why you buy what you buy and when you buy it, the y can use that information to boost r evenue.\\nConsumer buying behavior refers to the decisions and actions people undertake to buy pr oducts or services\\nfor personal use. In other wor ds, it ’s the actions you take befor e buying a pr oduct or service, and as you will\\nsee, many factors influence that behavior . You and all other consumers combine to make up the consumer\\nmarket .\\nThe Buyer ’s Black Bo x\\nIt stands to r eason that the hundr eds of millions of people who make up the global consumer market don ’t all\\nbuy the same pr oducts and services. Why do certain people pr efer differ ent items than others? The answer lies\\nin the factors that influence consumer buying behavior . One model of consumer buying behavior is what ’s\\nknown as the buyer ’s black bo x, which is named as such because little is kno wn about what goes on in the\\nhuman mind. It ’s also kno wn as the stimulus-r esponse model.\\nAs illustr ated in the model sho wn in Figur e 3.2 , consumer buying behavior is based on stimuli coming fr om a\\nvariety of sour ces—fr om marketers in terms of the 4Ps (pr oduct, price, pr omotion, and place) , as well as\\nfrom envir onmental stimuli, such as economic factors, legal/political factors, and technological and cultur al\\nfactors.\\nThese stimuli go into your “black bo x,” which consists of two parts: buyer char acteristics such as beliefs and\\nattitudes, motives, per ceptions, and values, and the buyer decision-making pr ocess, which is co vered later in\\nthe chapter . Your r esponse is the outcome of the thinking that takes place in that black bo x. What will you buy ,\\nwher e, when, ho w often, and ho w much?\\nFigur e3.2Stimulus-Response Model/Buyer ’s Black Bo x (attribution: Cop yright Rice University , OpenStax, under C C BY 4.0 license)\\nTypes of Consumer Buying Behavior\\nBuying behavior is not influenced solely b y the e xternal envir onment.

By that time,\\nyou’re likely convinced that ther e’s a significant differ ence among cars, and you’ve de veloped your o wn unique\\nset of criteria that helps you decide on your pur chase.\\nDissonance-r educing buying behavior occurs when you’ re highly involved in a pur chase but see little\\ndiffer ence among br ands. Let ’s say you’ re replacing the flooring in your kitchen with cer amic tile—another\\nexpensive, infr equent pur chase. Y ou might think that all br ands of cer amic tile in a certain price r ange ar e\\n“about the same,” so you might shop ar ound to see what ’s available, but you’ll pr obably buy r ather quickly ,\\nperhaps as a r esult of a good price or availability . However, after you’ve made your pur chase, you may\\nexperience post-pur chase dissonance (also kno wn as buyer ’s remorse) when you notice some disadvantages\\nof the tile you pur chased or hear good things about a br and you didn ’t pur chase.\\nHabitual buying behavior has lo w involvement in the pur chase decision because it ’s often a r epeat buy , and\\nyou don ’t per ceive much br and differ entiation. Perhaps you usually buy a certain br and of or ganic milk, but\\nyou don ’t have str ong br and lo yalty . If your r egular br and isn ’t available at the stor e or another br and is on\\nsale, you’ll pr obably buy a differ ent br and.\\nVariety-seeking buying behavior has the lo west customer involvement because br and switching is your\\nnorm. Y ou may not be unhapp y with your last pur chase of tortilla chips, but you simply want to try something\\nnew. It’s a matter of br and switching for the sake of variety r ather than because of dissatisfaction with your\\nprevious pur chase.\\nThe 4Ps and Consumer Beha vior\\nWatch this short, humor ous 4Ps video as a way to help you r emember the concept.

When you wer e a child, you learned basic values, per ceptions, wants, and\\nbehaviors fr om your family and other e xternal influences like the schools and chur ches you attended. Consider\\nhow these values and attitudes have shaped your buying behavior . For e xample, in a tr aditional Hindu\\nwedding in India, a bride may wear r ed lehenga to the wedding, wher eas Christian brides typically wear white.\\nIn India, wido ws ar e expected to wear white, wher eas wido ws in the United States and other parts of the world\\ngener ally wear mor e somber colors to a funer al.2\\nAsubcultur eis a gr oup of people, such as envir onmentalists or bodybuilders, who shar e a set of values.\\nEthnic and r acial gr oups shar e the language, food, and cultur e of their heritage.

Think about\\nwhat subcultur e(s) you may belong to and ho w the y influence your buying behavior . For e xample, hip-hop\\nmusic has long been associated with fashion, particularly sneakers. Run DMC’ s 1986 hit “My Adidas” led to the\\nfirst endorsement deal between a fashion br and and a musical act, setting the stage for lucr ative partnerships\\nspanning the decades since—Master P with Converse , Jay-Z and 50 Cent with Reebok , Missy Elliott and Big\\nSean with Adidas , and Dr ake with Nike .\\nFailures and Inspir ations\\nCultur al factors play a major r ole in determining ho w best to market to consumers.

Sociologists base definitions of social\\nclass on se veral differ ent factors, including income, occupation, and education. While ther e is disagr eement on\\nthe number of social classes defined b y income in the United States, many sociologists suggest five social\\nclasses: upper class, upper-middle class, lo wer-middle class, working class, and the economically\\ndisadvantaged.3Income is lar gely defined b y disposable income (the mone y you have left to spend or save\\nafter tax es ar e deducted), but its influence goes be yond just dollars, eur os, yen, etc. For e xample, a lo wer-\\nmiddle-class individual might focus primarily on price when considering a pr oduct, wher eas an upper-middle-\\nclass person might consider pr oduct quality and featur es befor e price. Ho wever, you also can be influenced b y\\na social class to which you don ’t belong but b y which you want to be accepted. Have you e ver spent mone y you\\nreally didn ’t have on br and name running shoes or a designer purse because that ’s what your friends have?\\nFinally , your gender plays an important r ole in your buying behavior . People of differ ent genders not only want\\ndiffer ent pr oducts as a r esult of their upbringing and socialization, but the y appr oach shopping itself with\\ndiffer ent motives, perspectives, and consider ations. While it ’s always danger ous to ster eotype, those who\\nidentify as male typically follo w a utilitarian, mor e logic-based appr oach when shopping. The y want a quick,\\neffortless shopping e xperience. Those who identify as female, on the other hand, make decisions on a mor e\\nemotional le vel.Zappos considers these differ ent motives and pr ovides differ ent layouts on their landing\\npages for differ ent genders.

Let ’s examine each, starting at the beginning.\\nStage 1: Need Recognition\\nThe buying pr ocess starts when you sense a differ ence between your actual state and your desir ed state. This\\nis referr ed to as pr oblem awar eness or need r ecognition. Y ou might become awar e of a need thr ough internal\\nstimuli (such as feeling hungry or thirsty when you’ re on a long r oad trip) or e xternal stimuli (such as passing a\\nbakery and smelling the wonderful ar oma of cookies baking).\\nSometimes r ecognizing the pr oblem or need is easy . You’ve run out of toilet paper or milk. But other times\\nrecognizing the pr oblem or issue is mor e complicated. For e xample, think about this first stage in terms of\\nyour decision to enr oll in college. What was the stimulus that trigger ed your inter est in attending college? Ar e\\nyou a working adult who has r ecognized that up ward advancement in your company won ’t happen without\\npossessing a college degr ee? Have you long aspir ed to be an entr epreneur , and you wanted to get some\\nbusiness and marketing courses under your belt so that you’ re better pr epar ed for the challenges of\\nentrepreneurship? Perhaps a car eer in marketing has been on your internal r adar since high school, and\\nyou’ve decided to take the plunge and get your degr ee in marketing. Or perhaps, after gr aduating fr om high\\nschool, your par ents gave you an ultimatum—either find a job or enr oll in college.\\nStage 2: Information Sear ch\\nNow that you’ve identified the pr oblem or need, you’ll be inclined to sear ch for mor e information. Ther e are\\ntwo differ ent sear ch states. The milder sear ch state is called “heightened attention,” in which you become\\nmore receptive to information about the pr oduct or service. The str onger sear ch state is called “ active\\ninformation sear ch,” in which you might do some r esear ch about the pr oduct or service on the Internet\\n(referr ed to as an internal sear ch), ask friends and/or family members their opinions (what ’s kno wn as an\\nexternal sear ch), or e ven visit stor es to vie w and touch the pr oduct (called an e xperiential sear ch).\\nKeep in mind, of course, that not all needs/pr oblems identified in Stage 1 will r equir e this second stage. If\\nyou’ve run out of br ead or toilet paper , you’ re probably not going to do an information sear ch; r ather , you’ll just\\ngo to the stor e to buy what you need, and your information sear ch may be as simple as checking prices at the\\ngrocery stor e to see if your favorite br and is available or another br and is on sale. Ho wever, pur chase decisions\\nof mor e consequence will usually trigger an information sear ch of some type.\\nAgain, consider the pr ocess you went thr ough in deciding which college to attend. What sour ces of\\ninformation did you use to find out about the colleges or universities you consider ed attending? Did you look\\nat their websites, talk with friends or family who attended that school, or perhaps e ven visit the campus and\\nmeet with an admissions counselor?\\nStage 3: Evaluation of Alternatives\\nConsumers ar e said to vie w a pr oduct or service as a “bundle of pr oduct attributes,” and you e valuate se veral112 3 • Consumer Markets and Pur chasing Behavior\\nAccess for fr ee at openstax.or g'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'principles_of_marketing.pdf', 'page': 20}, page_content='attributes of a pr oduct or service in r eaching your pur chase decision. For e xample, if you’ re buying a\\nsmartphone, you’ll consider factors such as battery life, speed, stor age capacity , or price. If you’ re booking a\\nhotel, you’ll pr obably consider its location, cleanliness, fr ee Wi-Fi, whether it has a fr ee br eakfast in the\\nmorning or a pool, and of course price.\\nWhat bundle of attributes did you use when e valuating your college alternatives? Y ou may have consider ed\\nfactors such as location, size of the campus, whether the school had the pr ogram of study you wanted, if it had\\nonline learning, and cost.\\nStage 4: Pur chase Decision\\nThis stage involves actually r eaching a decision on the pur chase of the pr oduct or service. One way people\\nnavigate all the information, e valuations, and choices in their pur chase decision is to use heuristics —mental\\nshortcuts or “ rules of thumb.” Heuristics ar e types of pr eexisting value judgments that people use to make\\ndecisions.\\nFor e xample, do you belie ve that the mor e expensive pr oduct is always of higher quality than the lo wer-priced\\nproduct? That ’s kno wn as the price = quality heuristic. Br and lo yalty is another heuristic people use in r eaching\\ntheir pur chase decisions. For e xample, do you eat cer eal? Do you always buy the same br and, or do you buy\\nwhate ver’s on sale or a br and for which you have a coupon? Country of origin is still another heuristic. Given a\\nchoice, do you pr efer to buy pr oducts made in the United States versus pr oducts made in other countries?\\nHow did you make your pur chase decision to enr oll in your college or university ? What heuristics did you use?\\nStage 5: Post-Pur chase Evaluation\\nAfter pur chasing the pr oduct or service, you’ll e xperience either satisfaction or dissatisfaction. Y ou may have\\nsecond thoughts after making a pur chase decision, and these doubts lead to cognitive dissonance , or buyer ’s\\nremorse—tension caused b y uncertainty about the corr ectness of your decision. This may lead you to sear ch\\nfor additional information to confirm the wisdom of your decision in or der to r educe that tension.\\nWhat determines if a consumer is very satisfied, some what satisfied, or dissatisfied with his or her pur chase?\\nSatisfaction is a function of the closeness between the buyer ’s expectations and the pr oduct ’s per ceived\\nperformance. If the pr oduct ’s performance falls short of e xpectations, you’ll be dissatisfied. If the pr oduct ’s\\nperformance meets your e xpectations, you’ll be satisfied, and if the pr oduct ’s performance e xceeds your\\nexpectations, you’ll be very satisfied.\\nThink about the pur chase decision you made when you decided to enr oll in your college or university . Are you\\nvery satisfied, satisfied, or dissatisfied with your decision? Refer to Table 3.1 for a summary of the five stages of\\nthe consumer decision pr ocess.\\nStage Description\\nStage 1:\\nNeed\\nRecognitionThe buying pr ocess actually starts when you sense a differ ence between your actual state\\nand your desir ed state.

For e xample, a consumer is\\nconcerned about the abuse of human rights in a for eign country , so corpor ate involvement in that country\\nmay be a factor in the consumer ’s pur chasing decisions. Similarly , consumers concerned about animal rights\\nmay consider whether a cosmetic pr oduct has been tested on animals. For e xample, in one 2017 surve y, 32\\npercent of US cosmetics consumers r eported that the y would “very likely ” stop pur chasing their favorite br and\\nif the manufactur er tested on animals.22\\nEthical Consumerism\\nEconomic theory suggests that consumers seek to maximize utility (the total satisfaction r eceived fr om\\nconsuming a pr oduct or service) at the lo west cost possible, so it follo ws that firms that have higher costs of\\nproduction will be driven out of the market. Recently , mor e and mor e firms have started using “ ethical” labels\\nas a means of product differ entiation , a marketing str ategy in which a br and identifies the one thing that\\nmakes it genuinely differ ent fr om competitors and then le verages that notion in its br anding and messaging.\\nBut what does this look like in action? Let ’s take a quick look at one popular br and that honed its\\ndiffer entiation str ategy and succeeded as a r esult.\\nLike many fast-food chains, Chipotle (see Figur e 3.13 ) focuses on the quality of its ingr edients abo ve all else.\\nOne of the br and’s hallmarks is that it works with family farmers within a 130-mile r adius of each of its\\nlocations and attempts whene ver possible to sour ce local and sustainably r aised ingr edients. Additionally ,\\nChipotle eliminated genetically modified (GMO) foods fr om its menu, citing public concerns about the safety of\\ngenetically modified ingr edients.23\\nFigur e3.13 Chipotle works with family farmers and has eliminated genetically modified foods as a way to differ entiate itself in the\\nmarket.

Ethical consumerism has become something of a buzzwor d over the last decade,\\nand or ganizations ar e taking notice of consumers’ e xpectations in terms of social and envir onmental pr actices.\\nConsider some statistics to better understand ho w consumers put ethical consumerism in pr actice:\\n•Accor ding to a Statista poll, 90 per cent of US surve y respondents indicated that the y would bo ycott a\\nbrand if the y disco vered that the company was engaged in irr esponsible business pr actices.24\\n•Resear ch fr omMintel , a market r esear ch firm, indicates that 56 per cent of US consumers indicate that\\nthey would no longer do business with or ganizations the y belie ve to be unethical.25\\n•A recent surve y sho wed that consumers seek a match between their beliefs and those e xemplified b y the\\norganization.

(cr edit: r eproduced with permission of Wir ed Coffee Bar)\\nDuring high school and college, Lisa worked in an upscale r etail boutique. On the mornings Lisa opened the\\nstore, she gr ew to lo ve the deep, rich smell of the coffee that would permeate the air fr om the local gourmet\\nfood stor e acr oss fr om the boutique. Her lo ve for coffee only deepened as she e xperienced local cafés\\nthroughout her tr avels while in college. In the back of her mind, she glamorized opening her o wn café.\\nThroughout her early thirties, Lisa looked at locations, talked with coffee entr epreneurs, de veloped business\\nfeasibility studies, and dr eamed of one day having her o wn place. One big pr oblem was finding the right\\ngeogr aphical ar ea wher e a small, independent coffee shop would be successful.\\nAfter mo ving for the fifth time, Lisa r ealized the ne w, growing community wher e she no w lived with her two\\nsmall childr en lacked one important thing—good coffee. The to wn was r apidly e xpanding and was the fastest-\\ngrowing community in the state of T ennessee. This might be the time and place to r evisit the idea of a coffee\\nshop.\\nEvery feasibility study Lisa completed pointed to the need for str ong community support. This ne w to wn had\\ntwo important ingr edients—college students and a bur geoning population.

Curr ently , if you wanted a\\ncoffee, the near est place to gr ab a cup was a Starbucks , which was o ver 20 minutes away . Starbucks made\\nspecialty coffee mainstr eam, but it seemed that sitting do wn to enjo y a cup of coffee was becoming a thing of\\nthe past. As mor e and mor e people began gr abbing their coffee fr om the drive-thr ough, could a community\\ncoffee bar with a wide variety of seating options and complimentary Wi-Fi be successful?\\nGoing forwar d with the idea, Lisa began to de velop Wired Coffee Bar . Prior to opening, Lisa went to e very local\\ncommunity e vent and pr ovided fr ee coffee for people to sample. Once the community had a taste of the coffee\\nand an e xpectation for the opening, ther e was an eager clientele waiting in line on the first day of business.\\nOne customer e ven hugged Lisa to thank her for bringing coffee to the community .\\nThe concept took off , and soon Lisa was a purve yor of fine coffee. Wir ed Coffee Bar was widely supported b y\\nthe community . The local chur ches lo ved to meet for a coffee drink and connect with friends and neighbors.\\nThroughout the day , business was conducted at the tables o ver a coffee, and into the e vening hours college\\nstudents gather ed to study and talk with friends.\\nIf you looked at the clientele thr oughout the day , you could see the “ grab and go ” customers who came e very\\nmorning to get their mochas, lattes, and cappuccinos. Into the late-morning hours, the tables filled up with\\nbusiness meetings—builders and their ne w clients, PT A groups, pharmaceutical sales r eps str ategizing for the\\nday and gr abbing coffee for customers, and moms meeting for coffee befor e picking up kids at school. As the\\nafternoon wor e on, the seats would fill up with high school students meeting with tutors and friends to\\ncomplete home work. The later e vening hours had e very seat filled with college students doing class pr ojects\\nor just “hanging out ” with friends.\\nWired Coffee Bar had a focused niche of coffee and community . The menu wasn ’t comple x. It featur ed just\\ncoffee—hot, iced, and fr ozen. Wir ed also offer ed a variety of teas that could be served hot or iced. Along with\\nthe drink options, customers could choose fr om a selection of sweet or savory locally baked muffins, scones,\\nquiche, cookies, and coffee cakes. But Wir ed was not a r estaur ant; the y wer e a true coffee bar .\\nWith a r egular and steady customer base, Wir ed could see the busier times happening when school was in\\nsession, and then summers saw a lighter r evenue str eam as the college students left and the local families\\ntook summer vacations out of to wn. The coffee business definitely needed the local support to offset the\\nvacation schedules of the college students.\\nJust as Wir ed Coffee Bar was hitting its stride, ne w coffee shops started to enter the once-dormant community .\\nEach ne w coffee location offer ed a drive-thr ough, something Wir ed Coffee Bar ne ver wants to be—fast-food\\ncoffee.
